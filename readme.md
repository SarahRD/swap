# About

Even in the digital era, it is still common to find small ads at the bakery...<br>
Do you want to practice sport out in the open?<br>
Do you offer PWYC "pay what you can" sport courses?<br>
Swap is here for you! As a different social network, SWAP helps you meet people that are similar, while democratizing alternative payment methods!<br>
Pay your teacher as you can, trade goods that you don't need anymore for a class, exchange services or pay with a local currency...<br>
Control the way you consume, towards a more ethical way of living.
